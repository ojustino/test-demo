for i,word in enumerate(words).

if words = 'knowledge of self determination'
The list comprehension above prints:
0 knowledge
1 of 
2 self
3 determination

You can turn strings upper or lower case with words.upper() or words.lower()

Example of object creation (with modules inside)

class MyObject(object):
	def __init__(self,x,y=None)
		self.x = x
		if y is not None:
			self.y -y
	def addme(self):
		return self.x + self.y
	def copy(self)***
		return copy.copy(self) 

*** If you said that a = obj.x, then said a = 6, that changes both a AND obj.x. Using copy.copy (like a = obj.x.copy()), the two initially related variables can become distinct entities.

Also, self doesn't need to be called in parentheses, because it's always implied.
